# Module 1 Final Project - Movie Analysis 

*My first project as a data science student!*


## The Task

"Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating."


## The Data

I have used the datasets I have been provided with, located in the 'Zipped Data' directory.
These consist of csv files with movies data from 'bom'(Box Office Mojo), 'imdb', 'rt'(Rotten Tomatoes) and 'tmdb' (The Movies Database).


## Working Notebook

**Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb** 

This notebook covers the data analysis and visualisation techniques carried out using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn.

1. Selecting research questions as required by the task. 
2. Data cleaning 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions - results and actionable insights from my findings 


## Findings

Non-technical presentation.


## Reflection & Future work

This project has been a great opportunity for me to practice and build on my new data science skills. I am now able to recognise and appreciate the power of these Python libraries, whilst being aware there is still much more for me to explore. 

Areas to further develop this project:
1. store datasets as databases and use SQL to explore them in different ways
2. web scraping to extract data on production teams/optimal release dates and times
